Real-time Prediction and Email Notification System for Diabetics Wound Treatment

Introduction

The code represents a real-time system for Diabetics wound treatment that integrates various machine learning algorithms and sends email notifications with prediction results. It utilizes sensor data to predict wound type, recommend electrotherapy parameters, and provide insights for chronic wound diagnosis. The system aims to enhance wound treatment efficiency and decision-making.

Key Features:

	Real-time prediction: Predicts Diabetics wound type using MLPClassifier and chronic wound diagnosis using RandomForestClassifier.
	Electrotherapy recommendation: Uses XGBoost Regressor to recommend optimal amplitude, frequency, pulse duration, and voltage for electrotherapy based on sensor inputs.
	Clustering: Performs K-means clustering to predict drug composition for Diabetics wound treatment.
	Email notification: Sends email notifications with prediction results and recommendations.

Technology Used:

	Programming Language: Python
	Libraries: pandas, Sklearn, XGBoost, flask, flask mail
Main Functionality
1.	Load and preprocess the dataset.
2.	Build machine learning models: MLPClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, KMeans, and XGBoost Regressor.
3.	Set up the Flask application and configure email settings.
4.	Define the function to send email notifications.
5.	Create the home route for receiving user inputs and making predictions.
6.	Process the user inputs, perform predictions using the trained models, and prepare the email content.
7.	Send the email notification to the designated recipient.

Skills Demonstrated:

	Machine learning: Applying MLPClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, KMeans, and XGBoost Regressor models for classification, clustering, and regression tasks.
	Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, data type conversion, and feature scaling using StandardScaler.
